The following steps, however, should be sufficient for most students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou need an active internet connection throughout the set up process. It is also recommended that you close all open programs on your computer before starting the installation.\n\n\nFollow the instructions corresponding to your operating system (MacOS users need to scroll down).\n\nMicrosoft Windows\n\nVisit the Anaconda website and click the Download button to download the Windows installer (see screenshot below). The download will start immediately. Wait until the installer (.exe) file downloads completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile waiting for the installer to download, you may encounter a pop-up window asking you to create an Anaconda Nucleus or Cloud account. This is optional and can be skipped by closing the pop-up window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you visit the Anaconda website and find your browser unable to display the entire contents then decrease the browser’s zoom setting.\n\n\nStart the installation by (double) clicking the installer file. Complete the installation process after reviewing and agreeing to the license terms. We recommend using the default options throughout. If asked, you can skip the PyCharm installation.\nRestart Windows to ensure the installation is complete.\n\n\n\nMacOS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSince version 10.8, macOS comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed. However, we need a Python 3 release. Python 3 is not backward-compatible with Python 2.\n\n\n\nVisit the Anaconda website and click the Apple icon followed by the Graphical Installer link corresponding to your macOS build. If you have an ARM build, using the M1 chip, select the second Graphical Installer (see screenshot below). The download will start immediately. Wait until the installer (.pkg) file downloads completely.\n\nMeanwhile you may encounter a pop-up window asking you to create an Anaconda Nucleus or Cloud account. This is optional and can be skipped by closing the pop-up window.\nDouble-click the downloaded file and click continue to start the installation.\nAnswer the prompts on the Introduction, Read Me, and License screens.\nClick the Install button to install Anaconda in your ~/opt directory. We recommend using the default options throughout. If asked, you can skip the PyCharm installation.  \n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Testing the installation\n\nMicrosoft Windows\nAnaconda Navigator is a graphical user interface that is automatically installed with Anaconda.\n\nLaunch the program by clicking Start and selecting Anaconda Navigator from the menu or by searching for it in the search box. (You may need to be patient as it loads the first time). Navigator will open if your installation was successful. It should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn some computer displays you may find that Navigator’s program window exceeds the screen size. Try resizing the window or, for a more permanent solution, go to File -&gt; Preferences in Navigator’s menu, uncheck ‘Enable high DPI scaling’, click “Apply”, and restart the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may be asked to update Navigator to a more recent release the first time you launch it! This is optional and can be skipped.\n\n\nLaunch Jupyter Notebook from within Anaconda Navigator. Create a new notebook from the dropdown menu at the upper right hand corner.\n\nAnd type the following code in a cell:\nprint(\"Hello world of business analytics!\")\nTo run, press Ctrl + Enter. If no error messages are shown and the message is correctly, then you’ve successfully installed Python and Anaconda!\n\n\n\nMacOS\nAnaconda Navigator is a graphical user interface that is automatically installed with Anaconda.\n\nLaunch the program by clicking Launchpad and select Anaconda Navigator.
